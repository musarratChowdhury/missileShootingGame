I would like a game developed for my web site that I am going to build. I have a new ground bar that is an improved version of an old device. The ground bar is used to protect radio and cell phone towers from lightning strikes.

I would like a game where you can choose to play as the new buss bar or the old version. In the game the bars fly around in the sky and block lightning bolts from zapping and destroying radio and cell phone towers. The longer you last the more clouds and lightning come.

In the game the bottom of the screen has towers a building with a sign that says “Your office”. There are also little people that constantly walk back and forth on the bottom of the screen with either cell phones or radios.

When a tower gets hit they seem to get mad because of no service and show a bubble over there head with a couple words or a ? or a !. When all the towers are destroyed the little people March over to the office building and set it on fire and the game ends.

The new version of the product can turn upside down and shoot.

The old rectangular version will be more funny to play. The controls would be backwards and upside down so when you try to make it go left it goes right etc. When it is hit by lightning it does not stop the lightning, but instead makes two bolts that then shoot towards the ground and do twice the damage.

I have cad drawings of the two products and some sketches of what I think the game could look like. I am colorblind, the new bar should be a gold color, the old one a dark copper. Normal colors for the sky, ground ect. I can give you files in other formats, I have some cad programs and photoshop.

Some sort of a scoring system and a leaderboard would be good with a total number of games played would be nice.
